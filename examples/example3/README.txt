WIP README

This is an example for a 1.0m cantilever beam geometry.
Geometry
1.0m x 0.1m x 0.2m

example3.py is for the triangulated meshes:
1000beam3DT is triangulated

example3tf.py is for the transfinite meshes:
1000beam2D is a 2D geometry 1.0m x 0.2m
1000beam3D is transfinite 67500 nodes
1000beam3D1 is transfinite 81920 nodes

email Ben @ bb515@cam.ac.uk for the Network.vtk , otherwise can build it yourself (will take some time)
it is too large for github
