# Probabilistic Peridynamics

This is an archived version of Ben Boys' contributions to the 'Probabilistic Peridynamics' code as of June 2020. For the most recent version please see:

Code base for 'Probabilistic Peridynamics' collaboration between Exeter, Cambridge &amp; Turing

# Installation

- Clone the repository `git clone
  git@github.com:bb515/probabilistic-peridynamics-project.git`
- Install using pip `pip install .`

# Running the tests

There are currently no tests for this version, but there may be some for the updated versions on https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Probabilistic-Peridynamics

# Documentation

Documentation for this peridynamics code is WIP and will be made available in time at https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Probabilistic-Peridynamics

However, a reasonable amount of information on the implementation of this solver and its capabilities is found in my Master's report:
